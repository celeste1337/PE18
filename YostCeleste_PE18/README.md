#PE18

##About
This project stores your read/recommended books. You can input the title, author, and whether you recommend the book to others. You can add or delete books as you wish.

##Classes
This project has two classes - the main and the Book class. The Book class allows a user to input many different books with different fields. The main class runs the program.

##Methods
This project uses methods primarily to do things the user wants. There is a Add, Delete, and Export. The Add method asks the user questions about their input, then creates a new book object and calls a book method that returns a string. The string can then be added to the list of books. The Delete method can delete the previous entry or all of the entries. Finally, the Export method writes all of the data in the list into the file (therefore updating the file with their current list).
